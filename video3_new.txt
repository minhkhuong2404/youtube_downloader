embassy siege 1980 location the Iranian  embassy South Kensington London day 6  british opinion was right on the spot  on may 5th the 6th day of the siege  things suddenly got worse as owen began  to be more and more suspicious about  noises that had come from the Ethiopian  embassy and the bricks that have moved  in the wall I once started to think that  the police were preparing to attack them  his suspicions grew bigger as no Arab  mediator appeared to begin negotiations  at 1300 hours that BBC radio broadcast  the news that there was still no  agreement on which Arab ambassador would  lead the negotiations and no one  realized he was being bluffed he picked  up the phone and told police negotiator  Vernon that they had 45 minutes to bring  the Ambassador or a hostage would die at  1345 hours three shots were heard from  inside the embassy as cobra was informed  of the situation they gave the order for  the SAS teams to prepare the assault at  1700 hours the commander of the 22 SAS  leftenant Colonel Michael Rose informed  that to SAS teams were ready to assault  the embassy at 1820 hours police  attempted to make another contact with  the terrorists through the Imam from the  local mosque during the conversation  another three shots were heard after  which the front door was opened and a  body was dumped onto the steps  it was the body of a Vaslav ahsani the  chief press officer and his zealous  supporter of the Islamic Revolution  Lavazza he was billed at 1345 while the  latest shots were only a bluff Oh  uninformed the police that the next  hostage would die in 45 minutes  lava Sonny's death meant the police's  job had ended and that SAS would take  over the operation afterwards Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher approved the  assault and inspector dello officially  handed over control to leftenant Colonel  rose at 1907 hours planning the assault  the successful police negotiations that  had lasted for five days had allowed the  SAS teams to devise a detailed plan for  assaulting the embassy at the beginning  they used a scale model of the 1st and  2nd floor made by police carpenters to  plan the attack both planning and  training were taken to a higher level  once the pioneer company of the Irish  Guards were engaged to build a life-size  replica of all floors this ensured the  assault was planned to every minut  detail it anticipated the simultaneous  assault both by blue and red teams a  total of 32 men those in blue team were  responsible for assaulting the basement  ground floor and the first floor whilst  those of the red team took the top three  floors it was of greatest importance for  all teams to attack the assigned floors  exactly at the same time they were to  clear the floors in the shortest  possible amount of time so that the  terrorists would not have time to  respond  blue and red team had the standard SAS  weapons and equipment designed for the  counter-terrorist operations they were  dressed in black assault suits for which  the SAS later became famous for the  upper body was protected with custom  body armor with high velocity plates the  head was covered by a grey flash hood  under which a standard army s-six gas  mask was worn each man had a radio with  a headset and built-in microphone to  maintain constant communication in the  assault on the Iranian embassy the SAS  soldiers were armed with heckler & koch  mp5 a3 submachine guns with a flashlight  mounted on top  browning nine millimeter high-powered  pistols and g60 stun grenade  mp5k x' and mp5 SDS were also used as  there were not enough mp5 a3 s to equip  all of the assaulters apart from  submachine guns Remington 870  pump-action shotguns and sledgehammers  were carried to blow off the door hinges  and locks and frame charges were carried  to breach the windows assault in 1923  hours assault teams received the  codeword Hyde Park which signal the abb√©  sailors to hitch their ropes it was  followed by another codeword London  Bridge the signal to start the attack  the assault would begin with a  diversionary explosion of the sky light  and the red and blue team attacks were  intended to happen simultaneously team 1  of red team came through the blown off  skylights to clear the third and fourth  floors they had the easiest task as both  floors were clear of terrorist presence  team two also of the red team abseiled  from the roof down to the rear of the  building  to the second floor as they were coming  down the team leader got stuck on his  harness as the other men tried to help  him one of them accidentally broke a  window there for alerting the terrorists  team 2 was supposed to wait for the  explosion but the course of the events  forced them to enter the building before  they planned to to the misfortune of the  entangled team leader the curtains had  caught on fire and began to burn him  through the broken window he suffered  some burns but somehow managed to evade  serious injuries the second abseiling  team released him by dropping him to the  second floor balcony with painful burns  the team leader entered the building  just as team two went in they realized  that the terrorists had barricaded  themselves and hostages in explosions in  the broken glass murdered the terrorists  who began  male hostages held in the Telex world  before the SAS came in the terrorists  had shopped three hostages of which one  had died instantly  sergeant Tommy Palmer was trying to find  another way in when he noticed a  terrorist trying to set fire to the room  Palmer's gun jammed but when the  terrorists fired his pistol he missed  the terrorists then ran into the Telex  floor but was shot dead as he was  pulling the grenade out another  terrorist was shot dead right there in  the world while one managed to disguise  himself amongst the hostages in the  nearby cypher room the SAS released  female hostages and took them along with  the others to the backyard they threw  the male hostages from soldier to  soldier to ensure that the remaining  terrorists didn't have time to act  aggressively as they were coming down  the stairs filled with CS gas one SAS  soldier noticed that concealed  terrorists pushed him down the stairs  after which another SAS soldier shot him  dead three to four magazines were  emptied into him to ensure he was dead  it was a good shot since the terrorists  was holding a grenade in his hand ready  to activate it as teams one and two were  sweeping the top floors team three from  the blue team assaulted the first floor  via the balcony which they climbed onto  from the adjacent building but Lance  Corporal Mackel is holding a frame  charge shouted at the hostage sim Harris  hope to move arm away they blew off the  window and stormed in after they threw  in flashbang grenades it was more than  two minutes after the red team entered  the building as they rushed through the  first floor rooms they bumped into Owen  wrestling with police constable walk  once Locke realized the assault was on  he took his concealed revolver and  attacked Owen then the door flew open  and a voice shouted Trevor get away  but dead by the SAS soldiers another  terrorist was spotted by the  ambassador's office he was wounded by  one SAS soldier and shot dead when he  lifted his pistol team four and team  five entered the building from the rear  by slamming the ground floor French  doors leading to the library their task  of clearing the ground floor and cellar  went smoothly as they found neither  terrorists nor hostages as the fire  began to rage through the building all  hostages were taken through the library  to the back yard there they were all  bound with cable ties as one terrorist  was still among them he was ultimately  recognized by Samaras and taken away by  the SAS soldiers the clock showed 1940  hours in just 17 minutes the SAS managed  to kill five terrorists capture one and  released 19 out of the 20 hostages only  one hostage was killed during the  assault he in the previously killed  Abbas olive ahsani - the only hostage  fatalities of the crisis once the  operation was over and the hostages
