The Revenge of the severed head 892 ad  back in the 9th century Britain was  fragmented into many small kingdoms and  was plagued by regular attacks from  Viking raiders originating from  Scandinavia it had become so bad that  many of these raiders had established  numerous permanent Viking colonies and  bases across Britain it was around this  time that the legendary King Alfred the  Great was battling to unify England in  an attempt to drive the Vikings from the  English shores once and for all one of  the smallest and most remote of these  Viking kingdoms was based in the north  of Britain on the small Scottish island  group known as the Orkney Islands this  had been given to raagh wolde I Stinson  the head of the house of I Stinson by  the Viking King of Norway Harald  fairhair  as compensation for the death of one of  his sons Ivar who died in a battle in  Scotland in the service of the king  Ivar had died fighting to reclaim the  Orkney Islands from renegade pirate  Vikings who had fled there to escape the  King's justice Rock vald would pass  power to his brother Sigrid Aisin son  second yarol of Orkney cigarette was  soon to become known as Sigurd the  mighty he had earned his title from his  heroic exploits he eventually had a  falling-out with another local Pictish  Lord by the name of mail Brigid the  buck-toothed of Moray named after his  apparent overbite  Sigurd decided to take the Lord's castle  for himself in order to expand his  territory further when mail refused to  hand over his territory  Sigurd challenged him to a 40-man battle  which was a traditional way to settle  differences in those times on the day of  the battle Sigurd cheated by bringing  along 80 men instead of the agreed 40  which allowed him to swiftly defeat mal  who he beheaded for his collection while  on horseback  Sigrid paraded around the severed head  as a trophy for all to see Sigurd had  even ordered all of his men to put  severed heads of the men they had slain  on their horses for the ride  to show the people how he had won a  great victory and killed his enemies  unfortunately for Sigrid he was about to  suffer one of the strangest deaths in  history as he and his men rode the long  journey home showing off his great  victory males head down his buck-toothed  had scratched against an open wound on  cigarettes lake too many looked like  males famous buck-toothed was seemingly  biting into the wound and some kind of  act of bloody vengeance from beyond the  grave as a result of the scratches from  the bloodied and severed head and the  bacteria that it carried entering his  bloodstream  Sigurd seemingly minor wound festered  became inflamed and infected creating a  foul stench before dawn arrived he was  dead he was buried where he died near a  Scottish town called Dornoch in a to us  a mound of earth raised over a grave  which would become known as Sigrid's how  it is said that after the funeral  Sigrid servants gathered his collection  of severed heads and noticed that male  had a big buck tooth grin and as if  cursed the region quickly fell into  chaos a Sigurd son cateura died  childless just a few months into his  reign then Sigrid's brother Rockwall  named his own son halat as the next Earl  of Orkney but almost immediately the  Orkneys started to be plagued by  constant renegade viking attacks after  only a short time halat gave up the  earldom and fled back to norway in  disgrace as abandoning his kingdom in  such an abrupt manner was seen as a  cowardly thing to do he died a short  time later a broken man meanwhile the  Orkney Islands had fallen under the rule  of two renegade Viking warlords but this  was short-lived as Holland's younger  brother anar reconquered the islands and  eventually established an i Tintin  ruling dynasty there that would last for  six more centuries  [Music]  hey guys check out this simple history  merch on teespring there's t-shirts mugs  stickers phone cases and much more link  in the description below
