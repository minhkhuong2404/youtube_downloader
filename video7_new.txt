assassination of John F Kennedy Friday  November 22nd 1963 John F Kennedy served  as president during the height of the  Cold War during his presidency he saw  the increase of military spending on  both nuclear and conventional forces and  increased the number of US advisors in  Vietnam from 400 to 16,000 the Bay of  Pigs fiasco the failure of 1,400 Cuban  exiles trained by the CIA to invade  their own country began at the start of  his presidency then there was the Cuban  Missile Crisis resulting in the USSR and  the USA is signing the test ban treaty  forbidding nuclear testing in the  atmosphere it also established the  hotline a direct telephone contact  between the White House and the Kremlin  during Kennedy's time in office the  Berlin wall was built by the Soviets in  order to stop refugees from fleeing from  East Germany to West Germany in Berlin  he delivered a speech challenging Soviet  oppression and gave hope to the people  of the city but in the winter of 1963  the presidency of John F Kennedy would  be tragically cut short  on November 21st 1963 President John F  Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline departed  on Air Force One for a two-day five-city  tour of Texas he was to announce his  candidacy for the 1964 presidential  elections there because Texas was vital  for his re-election Texans needed to be  convinced as the state was largely not  in favor of Kennedy's civil rights  policies and handling of foreign  policies like the Bay of Pigs fiasco the  feuding among Democratic Party leaders  there also hindered his chances of  reelection and they needed to be brought  together the next morning on November  22nd Kennedy made a speech to a large  crowd outside the hotel that he had  stayed in at Fort Worth and then made  another speech inside at a breakfast  hosted by the local Chamber of Commerce  he would say in the last speech he would  ever make this is a very dangerous and  uncertain world we would like to live as  we once lived but history will not  permit it the presidential party left  the Texas hotel and went by motorcade to  Carswell Air Force Base boarding Air  Force One landing at Dallas Love Field  Airport a short time later President  Kennedy and his wife shook hands with an  enthusiastic crowd and sat in the back  seats of their limousine as part of the  motorcade Democratic Texas Governor John  Connally and his wife were seated in the  seats in front of them in front of these  seats were two Secret Service agents the  president's next stop was the Dallas  Trade Mart approximately ten miles away  where Kennedy was scheduled to deliver  another speech it's estimated that about  200,000 people lined the route to the  Trade Mart the limousine the president  was traveling in was an open-top 1961  Lincoln Continental four-door  convertible limousine that was called  the SS 100 X by the Secret Service  the motorcade moved through Dealey Plaza  in downtown Dallas Nellie Connolly the  first lady of Texas turned around to the  president who was sitting behind her and  commented mr. president you can't say  Dallas doesn't love you  which President Kennedy acknowledged by  saying no you certainly can't those were  the last words ever spoken by John F  Kennedy at 12:30 p.m. the motorcade was  passing the grassy knoll to the north of  Elm Street and moving towards the Texas  School Book Depository then gunshots  were heard a bullet hit President  Kennedy's neck and hit governor Connally  shoulder and wrist a second shot then  hit President Kennedy in the head  covering the limousines rear interior  with fragments of skull blood and brain  the impact was so severe that blood and  fragments even landed on the Secret  Service car that was following behind  the limousine sped off to Parkland  Memorial Hospital within minutes but it  was already too late and doctors efforts  were in vain  Kennedy was declared dead at 1:00 p.m.  Connally would recover from his wounds  the country and the world was in shock  President Kennedy's body was taken from  Parkland Hospital to Love Field and  loaded onto Air Force One at 2:38 p.m.  sheltered on board Air Force One in case  of further assassination attempts lyndon  b johnson took the oath of office with  jacqueline kennedy by his side still  wearing her blood-spattered clothes the  oath was administered by US District  Court Judge Sarah Hughes less than an  hour earlier a person had been arrested  by the police witnesses had reported  hearing and seeing shots from different  directions but several accounts  mentioned the southeast corner window on  the sixth floor of the Texas schoolbook  depository building only two employees  from the building were missing one who  had walked outside and wasn't allowed  back into the building by police at the  time of the shooting and another Lee  Harvey Oswald would only been working  there for a month he had been seen and  described by the witnesses who saw him  in the sixth floor window so a  description was sent out by the police  as he moved down the floors he was  encountered by Dallas Police Officer  Marion L Baker who had his gun drawn he  was allowed to pass however because  Oswald's supervisor identified him as an  employee Oswald had slipped out of the  book  taury after the shooting and walked  several blocks caught a city bus and  then hailed a taxi and took him straight  to his boardinghouse there he picked up  a pistol and a coat and began to walk  aimlessly Oswalt had already left the  scene on a bus to his boarding house by  12:40 p.m. but the police did discover a  rifle underneath some boxes and its  shells by the window on the 6th floor as  witnesses had described the police  identified it as a 7.65 Mouser but later  the FBI announced that the police were  mistaken and the rifle was an Italian  Carcano m91 38 bolt-action rifle the  second-hand Italian made Carcano rifle  had been purchased by Oswalt earlier in  the year  under the alias a Hydell the Carcano was  a notoriously inaccurate weapon and for  many it's hard to believe that with such  a weapon oswald  despite his former military training  could hit a moving target like the  president twice with such precision at a  range of approximately 250 feet shortly  afterwards a dallas policeman by the  name of JD Tippit  was patrolling his usual area and saw a  man who fitted the Oswald description on  the corner of 10th Street and Patton  Avenue after a brief exchange of words  Oswald shot tip at four times with a 38  revolver killing him in front of  witnesses  Oswald ran to the nearby commercial  street of Jefferson Boulevard a man  named Johnny Calvin brewer noticed his  suspicious behavior and followed Oswald  for several blocks to the Texas theater  Oswald ducked there without buying a  ticket Brewer hailed the police officer  Nick McDonald who entered the theater  accompanied by another officer both  officers apprehended Oswald on the stage  of the Texas theater six blocks away  from the scene of the crime  1:50 p.m. what Oswald was arrested he  was carrying a forged identity card  bearing the name Alec J Hydell the alias  he used to buy the rifle however Texas  law imposed no control over the purchase  of weapons there was no reason to buy it  under an assumed name so why did as Walt  buy the rifle and a handgun by  mail-order under his assumed name  curiously army intelligence was known to  have a file on AJ Hidell the contents of  which were destroyed before it could be  acquired by investigators on Sunday  morning November 24th after being held  for two nights  Oswald was being transferred from city  jail to the County Jail  the event was being broadcast live on TV  from millions of Americans to see  suddenly out of nowhere a man shot a  pistol point-blank at Oswald who died  two hours later at Parkland Memorial  Hospital  the man who fired the pistol was Jack  Ruby a local nightclub owner he said  that he killed Oswald to spare mrs.  Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back  to trial the state funeral for President  Kennedy was held on November 25th 1963  with representatives from more than 100  countries and millions of viewers  watching it on television on November  29th 1963 president lyndon b johnson  created the President's Commission on  the assassination of President John F  Kennedy also known as the Warren  Commission after its chairman Earl  Warren Chief Justice of the United  States  it's 888 page final report was presented  to Johnson on September 24th 1964 the  Warren report concluded that Oswald who  had become a skilled marksman as a  Marine had fired three shots one that  entered Kennedy's neck and exited  through his throat before hitting  Connally one that hit Kennedy in the  back of the head the fatal shot and one  that missed the president ricocheted off  a piece of sidewalk which injured James  take many disagreed with these findings  and argued instead that there had been a  second shooter on the grassy knoll in  Dealey Plaza that the motorcade had been  approaching and there were witnesses who  thought they had heard shots coming from  the direction of a rim  Road beyond the Knoll the report however  concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and  Jack Ruby had acted alone although the  findings of the Warren Commission  continued to be controversial  [Music]  you
