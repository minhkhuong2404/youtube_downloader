casualty among the  26 hostages during the assault the  Iranian embassy siege began on Wednesday  April 30th 1980 when six members of the  so-called Democratic Revolutionary front  for the liberation of Erebus dan or dr  fla stormed the iranian embassy at  sixteen princes gate south kensington  london UK the reason behind the attack  was because of the oppression of the  arab population in the oil wealthy  province of Khuzestan or arabistan as it  was called by the arabs by the new  Iranian regime led by Ayatollah Khomeini  the attack on the embassy in London was  to get the attention of the world and  especially Arab countries towards their  issue  the terrorists arrived in London one  month earlier on March 31st the leader  of the DeLuca's Oh an ally Mohammed or  Salim Tokai an Arab political activist  from Iran and the only member of the  group that spoke English during the one  month preparation the terrorists  equipped themselves with weapons that  were smuggled into the United Kingdom  likely via an Iraqi diplomatic shipment  Owen and his associates were armed with  two Polish made scorpion machine pistols  three browning hp-35 pistols loaded with  nine millimeter Winchester hollow-point  ammunition one 38 caliber revolver and  several Soviet  rgd five grenades  day one  at 1125 hours the group slammed the door  and captured the police constable Trevor  Locke from the diplomatic protection  group constable Locke had his radio  taken but only after he managed to press  the panic button without being noticed  sending an emergency signal to Scotland  Yard besides he managed to keep his 38  caliber revolver secret from the  terrorists in just a few minutes the  terrorists took control the entire  building taking 26 hostages 17 of them  were Iranian members of the embassy  staff eight of them were visitors and  constable walk among the visitors the to  BBC employees sim Harris and Chris  Kramer the hostages were gathered and  undeclared their demands autonomy for  Arava Stan the release of 91 Arab  prisoners from Iranian prisons as well  as a plane to fly themselves and the  hostages out of the UK the deadline to  meet the demands was sent to noon May  first under the threat that the whole  embassy would be blown up alerted by the  panic button on constable Locke's radio  the Metropolitan Police responded  immediately in just a few minutes Deputy  Assistant Commissioner John de l'eau  appeared in front of the embassy and  establish an improvised command post in  his car as the situation developed the  post was moved to the building of the  Royal School of needlework and then to  the nearby Montessori nursery school the  first thing the police did after sealing  the area was to establish a contact with  Iran by the field telephone that was  dropped inside the embassy the field  telephone was chosen as it would  continue to record conversations even  when it was not being used Metropolitan  Police Chief Inspector max Vernon became  the negotiator on the other end  soon after the place was filled with an  entire army of journalists and TV crews  the British authorities quickly became  aware of the seriousness of the  situation a crisis management team  gathered in the Cabinet Office briefing  room also known as Cobra chaired by  William white law the Home Secretary  as the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  was unavailable Cobra agreed that the  police were to lead the negotiations but  in case of hostages being harmed the  army would step in that is the SAS would  commence a military assault even though  the peaceful solution was that  priority the British government was  determined not to give in to the  terrorists and in no case allow them to  flee the country the British also had to  count on the fact that there wasn't the  slightest possibility that the Iranian  government would give in to the  terrorists demands the Iranian  government was also eager to use the  situation in their favor and to portray  the captured embassy personnel as  martyrs in the afternoon the hostage  takers would release an ill hostage  freedom Oh Safari on a press officer day  2 on May 1st to SAS teams red and blue  arrived at the region's parks barracks  and white Range Rovers and then they  moved into the building at number 14  through 15 that belonged to the Royal  College of General Practitioners that  was next door to the embassy to remain  unnoticed the SAS sneaked into the  building through back alleys under the  cover of night the other building right  next to the terrorists the residents of  the Ethiopian embassy was occupied by  mi5 technicians who were assigned to  eavesdrop on the terrorists they did it  with the help of microphones put inside  holes in walls they drilled with small  hand drills as a distraction for the  noise they made by the drills passenger  aircraft landing at Heathrow were  redirected to fly at a low altitude over  the embassy inside the embassy on was  having difficulty with another ill  hostage Chris Kramer since his condition  was worsening with each passing minute  and police were not willing to send in a  doctor no one had no choice but to  release him the first thing Chris Kramer  did once he was free was to give  information to the police  about the hostage takers the most  important moment of the day was noon  when the deadline was set for the Arab  prisoners to be released  however as nothing happened when  postponed the deadline to 1400 hours the  British authorities were certain that  Iran was not ready to fulfill his  threats and intentionally let the second  deadline pass as well after the second  deadline passed it became evident that  they were right Owen also realized that  his demands were never going to be met  and decided to change them  his new demands were that three  ambassadors from three Arab countries  Iraq Jordan in Algeria should come and  serve as mediators for the terrorists  safe passage from the UK day three the  third day of the hostage crisis brought  about nothing but new demands set by  Iran  otherwise he would kill Abdul Fuzzy's  izzati the cultural attache since the  police refused to reinstall previously  cut off telephone and telex lines Owen  asked for a man from the BBC who knew  Harris one of his hostages to dictate  him his demands at 1500 hours  Tony Crabb editor of BBC TV news arrived  to note down Owens demands these were  the arrival of one Arab man bassinger as  negotiator a coach for the terrorists  hostages and ambassador to be taken to  Heathrow Airport for non Iranian  hostages to be released at the airport  and finally an aircraft to take the  terrorists ambassador and the rest of  the hostages to one of the Arab  countries presumably Iraq with the  remaining hostages would be released one  requested that these demands should be  broadcast by the BBC on the evening news  later that evening BBC radio only  briefly broadcasted the terrorists  demands and even misinterpreted them Oh  on was furious day for  [Music]  a zero six or five hours on May third  one yelled at Vernon by the field  telephone line about being cheated he  demanded Tony crab from the BBC to  return in order to take new notes on his  demands our hostage would be killed this  time the police had no choice but to  give in to owens demands at 1530 hours  crab appeared and after being  reprimanded by his hostage friend harris  he took notes exactly as Owen told him  police negotiator Vernon ensured Owen  his demands would be broadcasted in his  exact words in return he asked Iran to  release two hostages which he agreed as  arranged the first hostage a pregnant  woman named Hyatt congi was released  before the demands were broadcasted by  the BBC radio and the second le gweal  gun safar pakistani tourist was released  after the news demands were broadcasted  by Scotland Yard's head of information  word-for-word even though the police  seem to have things under control  preparations for the military assault  were still in progress at 2300 hours at  SAS team moved quietly across the  rooftops to reach the roof of the  Iranian embassy  once there they spotted a skylight that  could serve as a potential entry point  on the back end of the roof SAS soldiers  secured the abseil ropes for entry  through the windows day 5 broadcasting  their demands was a small victory for  the terrorists and definitely improved  their mood on day 5 of the siege they  received the news that the Arab  ambassadors agreed to meet the British  in order to solve the crisis as a sign  of goodwill they let another hostage go  the journalist Mustafa Carr Kuti Cobra  on the other hand didn't have any hopes  that the crisis would end in a peaceful  manner the SAS made detailed plans to  storm the embassy and were ready to drop  in at any moment  you  you
