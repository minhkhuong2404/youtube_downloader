the Aleutian Islands campaign Attu and  Kiska territory of Alaska the Aleutian  Islands campaign was a military campaign  led by US and Canadian forces on the  islands of Attu and Kiska it was the  only land battle fought on US soil in  World War two apart from that the  invasion of the Kiska island known as  operation cottage is remembered as one  of the most bizarre actions in the  entire war during two days of sweeping  the island Allied forces had more than  300 casualties while the Japanese had  none the reason for this was that there  were no Japanese soldiers to fight in  the first place in June in July 1942 the  Japanese forces led by Admiral Yamamoto  invaded the aleutian islands of Attu and  Kiska the Japanese did this as a  diversion from their Midway campaign but  also to prevent the Aleutians being used  as a forward base for the Americans to  attack Japan capturing the island was a  relatively easy job for the Japanese  forces as it was defended by negligible  forces ten US Navy officers from the  American weather station as soon as they  took control of the islands the Japanese  started building airfields and  fortification systems in the inland  mountains they even brought in five  hundred civilians to build new military  bases tunnels and harbors since the  Americans were fighting Japan primarily  for the domination over the Pacific  Ocean there was no doubt for them that  the islands had to be liberated as soon  as possible  there was also another reason why the  United States was so eager to get its  territory back Kiska and Attu were the  first pieces of American territory to be  conquered since the war of 1812 with the  United Kingdom their repatriation was  therefore a matter of national pride as  well the islands were under the  protection of the Alaska Defense Command  or ADC which only had twenty four  thousand members the US Army didn't  waste its time and immediately started  building up its troops in Alaska for the  upcoming invasion by autumn 1942 the  size of the ADC had increased to over  ninety four thousand the first target  was the island of ah - ah - was of  secondary importance compared with Kiska  which had  fully developed harbour an operational  airfield and a larger garrison however  by aiming to conquer a two first the US  Army wanted to cut the Japanese  communication with Kiska operation land  crab after almost a year of occupation  Navy ships carrying the 17th Infantry  Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division of  the US Army approached a - on May 11th  landing on the island went unopposed  which gave American soldiers a false  impression that it was going to be an  easy task for them  the Japanese had intentionally withdrawn  from the coast - prepared fortifications  and bunkers in the inland mountains they  used the natural defenses as well such  as the caves and crevasses over there  they showed a fierce resistance to  American troops fighting to the very end  after 19 days of battle only 28 Japanese  soldiers out of 2630 of the 300 and 1st  infantry battalion survived the  Americans also suffered enormous  casualties 3829 men out of 16,000  engaged many of these were due to  unsuitable equipment which led to the  soldiers getting frostbite and other  medical conditions on top of this many  of the soldiers had never seen active  combat the AH - experience was  horrifying to the American soldiers and  largely influenced what happened on  Kiska a few months later operation  cottage  aerial reconnaissance of Kiska recorded  a whole system of fortifications similar  to those on a - besides intelligence  estimated that they were to expect  around 10,000 Japanese soldiers  everything was indicating that Kiska was  to be the next a - however in late July  reconnaissance planes recorded reduced  Japanese activity on the island there  was almost no anti-aircraft fire no  movements in the harbor and destroyed  buildings were not repaired even radio  communications were missing the radio  signals stopped entirely on July 28th  however the signals of something being  very wrong were ignored by Vice Admiral  Kincaid this might have been because the  Americans had the events of aw - fresh  on their minds during July the US Air  Force and Navy had conducted severe  bombings and shellings of the island  leading some officers to think that this  may have forced the Japanese to leave  the island  Vice Admiral Thomas Kincade who was in  charge of the entire operation had a  different impression he thought that the  Japanese had withdrawn to their  labyrinth of tunnels and trenches inland  as they did on a - for him there was no  doubt that the Americans would have to  fight bitterly for the island for the  liberation of Kiska the US Army engaged  more than 34,000 soldiers of the 7th  Infantry Division including the 17th  infantry regiment the 53rd Infantry  Regiment the 184th Infantry Regiment the  4th Infantry Regiment the 87th mountain  infantry regiment and the first Special  Service Force except for the first  Special Service Force this force  consisted of young and inexperienced  soldiers for most this was their first  combat experience for the invasion of  Kiska US forces were reinforced by 5,300  Canadians of the 13th Royal Canadian  Infantry Brigade codenamed the green  light force this unit included the  Winnipeg grenadiers 's the Rocky  Mountain Rangers the Canadian Fusiliers  and other smaller formations on August  15th 1943 American troops began their  landing operation on the middle part of  the island coming from the north  their entire operation went badly from  the start as ships carrying tanks became  stranded because of poor tide  calculations stranded ships then caused  a traffic jam causing a great delay  luckily for the Allied forces their  landing was unopposed as there was no  Japanese resistance however this didn't  give the American soldiers any peace of  mind they were well aware that they were  in the same situation as their comrades  were on a too dense fog and extremely  cold winds increased the feeling of  anxiety and disorientation on August  16th American soldiers began moving  inland on the same day Northwest from  their positions the Canadians began  their landing operation as both  contingents were moving slowly through  dense fog and cold rain they found no  Japanese resistance all they could find  were abandoned positions and an unusual  discovery one dog named explosion that  used to belong to the American soldiers  who were captured by Japanese Marines in  the initial landings a year ago at the  same time the American and Canadian  troops were suffering casualties talk  spread amongst the troops that there  were Japanese snipers and soldiers  around which created a sense of panic  many of them bumped into Japanese  minefields and booby traps which were  very difficult to notice because of the  fog that reduced visibility to less than  a few feet the destroyer Abner Reid  struck a mine when entering the harbor  on Kiska killing 70 sailors and wounding  47 but adding greatly to the disaster  was when many of the killed and wounded  soldiers were victims of sporadic  friendly fire as soon as troops landed  they spread out through the thick fog on  August 16th  a Canadian soldier mistakenly fired on  American soldiers believing they were  Japanese it caused the friendly fire  shootout that resulted in 28 Americans  and for Canadians killed around 50 men  were wounded on either side  inexperienced soldiers were terrified by  the stories of the otter carnage and  disoriented by the harsh weather  conditions and poor visibility caused by  the fog Brian Murphy a US Army  lieutenant who is at Kiska during the  ordeal later recalled that the troops  were shooting at anything that moved  one infantryman attacked what he thought  was an enemy Patrol and despite patrol  members shouting at him to stop he  proceeded to throw grenades  he was then immediately shot by friendly  fire they had anticipated a surprise  Japanese attack at any moment with their  nerves on edge these young soldiers  fired upon the slightest suspicion of  enemy presence after three days of  patrolling the island American and  Canadian soldiers finally realized that  there was no enemy to fight as the  Japanese had already left Kiska after  the Second World War had ended it became  known through interrogations that the  decision to retreat from Kiska was made  after the Battle of Attu back in May  Japanese soldiers were also frightened  by the a2 scenario and were additionally  aware that any resistance was pointless  in a situation when the Japanese army  was desperately in need for soldiers  they were allowed to return to posts  closer to home back on July 28th they  were carried by several cruisers and  destroyers 5,000 Japanese soldiers had  broken through the American naval  blockade they did it with the help of  the thick fog operation cottage was met  with condemnation in the American press  even though the islands were liberated  from the enemy 92 killed in action and  221 wounded soldiers was a lot to take  in for a battle with no enemy present  lessons were learned from operation  cottage and the disastrous landing  operations proved to be a good drill for  similar campaigns until the end of the  war  hey guys check out this simple history  merch on teespring there's t-shirts mugs  stickers phone cases and much more link  in the description below
