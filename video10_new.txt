[Music]  [Laughter]  Britain's most violent prisoner the 20th  century Charles Bronson was born Michael  Gordon Peterson on December 6 1952 in  the town of Luton Bedfordshire England -  era and Jo Pearson he was also one of  three brothers and was from a  respectable family by all accounts he  was a nice and likable child but as he  grew up and became a teenager he started  to get more and more into trouble during  his school years he was constantly  playing truant preferring a life of  petty crime but more worryingly a nasty  streak started to emerge in him as he  enjoyed more and more getting into  violent fights after Peterson left  school he had trouble holding down  steady employment he ended up doing a  number of different jobs over the next  few years including working in a  supermarket where he attacked his  manager on building sites in various  factories and even as a furniture  remover but none of these jobs lasted  very long and more often than not he was  quickly fired for his abrupt manner and  fierce temper the only thing Peterson  seemed to have an affinity for was crime  in the three years after he left school  he got into trouble for a variety of  things like smashing up parked cars  after an argument with his girlfriend's  father crashing a stolen lorry and being  involved in a smash-and-grab raid but  luckily for him each time he was only  fined and given probation then it seemed  that he may well had learned his lesson  and grown out of this rebellious in a  self-destructive stage for 1971 at the  age of 19 he met Irene Kelsey they fell  quickly in love and married the  following year  shortly afterwards they were blessed by  the birth of a baby boy  but soon he was back to his old ways and  in 1974 he was convicted of the serious  crime of armed robbery and sentenced to  seven years in prison during this time  Irene divorced him and his incarceration  turned out to be a lot longer than the  original sentence as he earned an extra  six years for repeatedly attacking  prison guards and fellow prisoners often  with broken glass bottles as well as for  damaging prison property he was seen as  such a dangerous inmate that he had to  spend long stretches of time in solitary  confinement and at times he had to be  sedated or kept in Chains as he was so  unstable and violent Peterson ended up  in a high-security psychiatric ward his  behavior then became even more erratic  and he staged several rooftop protests  as well as a short-lived hunger strike  when he was finally released in 1987  after 13 years in prison he embarked on  a short-lived career as an illegal  bare-knuckle boxer in the East End of  London he adopted the stage name of  Charles Bronson who was a famous  American actor in the 1960s and 70s who  often played tough law enforcement  officers or moralistic vengeful  vigilantes just a year later he robbed a  jewelry shop surprising his girlfriend  with a ray and selling off the rest  charged under his fighting name Charles  Bronson he gave up his old name of  Peterson after 69 days of freedom he was  back in custody convicted of armed  robbery for robbing a jewelry shop and  was sentenced to another seven years in  prison  once again Bronson is far from being a  model prisoner he continued to attack  prison guards and fellow prisoners so  much so that he had to be moved numerous  times and his reputation became so bad  that one prison in Bedford refused to  have him by attacking others he was not  only adding to his sentence but also  earning transfers between prisons  subsequently because of his antisocial  behavior he again spent a considerable  amount of time in solitary confinement  surprisingly he only served four years  of his sentence and was released from  prison in 1992 in a few months he was  back inside again accused of planning a  robbery  though the  were eventually dropped but he was found  guilty of assault for breaking the nose  of the boyfriend of an ex-girlfriend and  despite his criminal and violent past he  escaped prison time and was given a 600  pound fine you would have thought that  Bronson might have tried to control his  anger issues but just 16 days later he  was again arrested this was for planning  another robbery and for illegally  possessing a sawn-off shotgun a very  serious crime in Britain which has some  of the toughest anti gun laws in the  world while he was unromantic a library  and hostage demanding among things a  helicopter an inflatable doll and a cup  of tea Bronson was disgusted at the  hostage when he farted in front of him  so he released him  the situation was then diffused by the  police negotiators who never gave him  his helicopter there is no record if the  police gave in to his demands for a cup  of tea at his trial Bronson was found  guilty for possessing a shotgun and was  given an 8-year sentence in 1993 his  behavior was now getting totally out of  hand and in 1994 he took the deputy  governor of Hull prison hostage for four  hours then the following year he  attacked the governor of hide down  prison in North Surry it didn't stop  there in 1996 while in Birmingham prison  he took a doctor hostage which luckily  and did peacefully later that year he  took three fellow prisoners hostage and  made more colorful demands like asking  for a plane to take him to Libya as well  as an Uzi submachine gun 5000 rounds of  ammunition and an axe he also demanded  ice cream and slashed himself with a  razor before surrendering a further five  years was added to his sentence for  these offences but Bronson's disruptive  behavior kept on continuing in 1999 he  took a civilian education officer  hostage for 44 hours and went on a  rampage because he criticized one of his  drawings he wrecked part of the prison  damaging fridges washing machines and  furniture as he did so finally the  authorities had no choice but to give  Bronson a life sentence as he was  obviously a habitual and violent  criminal they could see he was beyond  rehabilitation and forever a danger to  the public and himself the sad truth of  the matter was that in the last 25 years  he was only out of prison for a grand  total of six months because he was such  a difficult prisoner they were forced to  build a special high security unit at  wood Hill prison to house him and other  ultraviolent prisoners but finally  things did seem to change in Bronson for  the good when he married a mother of one  Bangladeshi divorcee who had only just  started to visit him  Bronson converted to his new wife's  faith and for a time Bronson started to  call himself Charles Ali Achmed  he seemed for a while much more stable  and it looked like married life had a  calming effect on him but in 2005 after  four years of marriage the couple  divorced and he renounced his faith by  2007 he was back to his old ways and  prison guards narrowly avoided yet  another hostage situation several times  Bronson appealed against his life  sentence as well as requesting parole  but he was refused every time in 2013 he  even appealed to British Prime Minister  David Cameron to be released backed up  by a petition of 10,000 signatures  supporting this request however this  request was point-blank Lee denied then  in 2014 Bronson legally changed his name  to Charles Salvador in honor of one of  his great idols Salvador Dali the  Spanish surrealist painter with  Bronson's reputation for violent and  destructive outbursts spanning over four  decades he may never be released from  prison his reputation for being the most  notorious and violent prisoner in  Britain is well deserved but what made  him that way  psychiatrist can't seem to agree what is  actually wrong with him it may well be  that he is simply a man with a lot of  anger-management issues for Bronson has  said on many occasions he has a short  violent temper that he finds hard to  control behind his violent exterior is  someone who was well-read and said to be  highly intelligent Bronson is a talented  artist and a war  winning poet and a published author of a  variety of books he's also a fitness  fanatic and maybe he has finally calmed  down as recently when much to his  disgust his prison served croquettes  instead of chips at lunchtime rather  than hold a person hostage or attack  someone he instead filed a strongly  worded formal written complaint to the  prison authorities it took a lot of  security to take on this prisoner but to  protect yourself all you need is Nord  VPN secure yourself from online
