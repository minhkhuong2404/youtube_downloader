creeping barrage military tactic World  War one a creeping barrage also known as  the rolling barrage was an artillery  tactic of World War one it included the  gradual advance of artillery fire in  order to provide cover for the infantry  pushing forwards towards the enemy  trenches however it was difficult to  carry out in practice it wasn't until  the great war that our Tillery was  employed on such a large scale and with  such great firepower any kind of  military attack was practically  impossible to imagine without artillery  being used in support for all the  combatants artillery was the key in  overcoming the stalemate of trench  warfare a standard tactic of employing  artillery was by firing a massive  bombardment on the enemy position the  aim was to completely destroy the  enemy's defensive capabilities along  with inflicting maximum casualties after  the barrage was stopped sometimes even  after a few hours of shelling the  infantry were ordered to charge across  no-man's land and seize the undefended  enemy trenches this however only seemed  to work in theory and was almost never  achieved in reality the problem with a  standard barrage was that the enemy  bunkers solid enough to withstand the  shelling were built already in the early  stages of the war they allowed soldiers  to stay safely protected and able to  wait for the barrage to cease once the  shelling had stopped it was their cue to  rush outside as quickly as possible to  repel the advancing enemy infantry also  even if the shelled area was destroyed  the defensive army had time to send  replacement forces into the area to  defend the position the charging party  meanwhile often had no sufficient time  to cross the distance of no-man's land  before the enemy man their defensive  positions this would leave them standing  as sitting ducks in the middle of the  space between the two trench lines even  if they managed to reach the other side  barbed-wire defenses were often  undamaged and would slow them down in  late 1915 and early 1916 an idea emerged  that the tactic  the creeping barrage might work in  overcoming the stalemate situation it  was the British who first tried to use  it however the tactic was not their  invention it was first used by Bulgarian  units in the first Balkan war during the  1913 siege of the Turkish city of Eden a  ancient adrianople the Bulgarians used  the tactic to cover their troops that  were charging the city defense lines it  was exactly what the British and French  needed the main idea of the creeping  barrage was to commence shelling on  no-man's land and then gradually  increased the range in pre-arranged  paces until the enemy's positions were  reached the usual creeping pace was 54  yards or 50 meters per minute but if  needed  it could be increased or decreased the  main aim of the tactic was not to  destroy the enemy's defenses but to  provide cover for the charging infantry  once the infantry was near enough  however damage to the enemy's defenses  was possible the pace of the creeping  barrage was planned to be followed by  infantry their task was to walk just  behind the dropping shells in front of  them explosions and smoke would cover  their advance and prevent the enemy from  effectively engaging against them once  the barrage passed over the enemy  trenches it would stop an infantry would  be in a good position at just a few  yards away in this state the enemy had  no time to get out of their bunkers to  organize the defense of their positions  there was also a variation of the tactic  called the fire waltz once the barrage  reached the enemy positions and went  beyond them it would then reverse its  course just to catch enemy soldiers  running out from their bunkers the  creeping barrage was a very risky tactic  since soldiers were dangerously close to  exploding shells it was therefore of  greatest necessity that this tactic was  thoroughly planned before it was put  into action in order to coordinate  infantry and artillery accurate barrage  maps were created withdrawn in zones for  bombardment and scheduling a fire if the  infantryman failed to keep up with the  pace of the brush they  be left far from enemy trenches once the  shelling had stopped on the other hand  if the infantrymen were too hasty they  would catch up with their own artillery  fire and get blown to pieces the same  went for artillery in order to make the  creeping barrage sustainable infantryman  and artillery men had to be well  coordinated especially as there was no  easy communication between them it was a  tactic that required a lot of training  for which Allied troops had no time to  properly prepare the poor coordination  between infantry and artillery became  obvious during the first time the  creeping barrage was applied on a large  scale this was during the Battle of the  Somme from July 1st to November 18th  1916 forces led by General Sir Henry  Sinclair horn at the honour of testing  the creeping barrage tactic once the  barrage started to roll infantrymen were  constantly at a distance from the  dropping shells whether the artillery  was moving too fast our soldiers were  afraid of getting hit once the barrage  stopped British soldiers were in the  middle of no man's land they were far  away from the enemy positions they were  supposed to reach and too distant from  their own positions to retreat standing  unprotected on the field they were  massacred by German machine guns on the  other hand during the Battle of Vimy  Ridge the Canadians applied to tactic on  a much smaller scale than at the Somme  the battle began on Easter Monday April  9th 1917 at 5:30 a.m. with the creeping  barrage applied at a pace of 100 yards /  3 minutes which was much slower than  normal the barrage pace was perfectly  maintained to the end and was closely  followed by the Canadian infantryman it  became known as the Vimy glide the  flawlessly conducted creeping barrage  allowed the Canadians to capture several  well-protected German lives and to end  the battle in just three days taking  everything into consideration the  creeping barrage tactic did have some  successes it was especially the case  when belligerence began using the tactic  for smaller scale battles however  successful or not the tactic failed to  fulfill  the initial demands of commanders in  bringing a decisive victory and it could  be devastating to infantry as the  failures in the Battle of the Somme and  the Battle of Bellevue spur show it  became more successful as war planners  learned to use it effectively at battles  like those at Messines and gravan STOVL  spur in 1917 after the war was over and  warfare changed the creeping barrage  tactic declined he hadn't used  occasionally during World War two such  as the battles of El Alamein Monte  Cassino and even at Normandy the Soviets  also used it on a large scale in any  case by the time of world war ii the  creeping barrage tactic became obsolete  the development of radio allowed  soldiers to be in constant connection  with artillery and to call and fire  exactly where and when they needed it  [Music]
