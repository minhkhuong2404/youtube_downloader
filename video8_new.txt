Peter freaking the Explorer who used a  knife made of his own poop to escape  from the ice there is no doubt that  Lorenz Peter elfrid Freudian where Peter  Freudian as he was met or known was a  most truly remarkable character and it  seems nothing was beyond this incredible  Danish man he came from a humble  background being born in 1886 in Denmark  - a very normal family  Peter studied medicine at the University  of Copenhagen but after listening to a  student speak about polar explorers he  dropped out to become an arctic explorer  he also found time over his long career  to become an accomplished author a well  respected journalist and an  award-winning Hollywood scriptwriter a  renowned anthropologist and a brave  world war two resistance fighter he was  also married three times he had two  children with his first wife an Inuit  woman named Nava Rana  makuu Pollock but she sadly died in 1921  during the great Spanish flu pandemic  since Baku Pollock was not a member of  the church the local priest refused to  allow her to be buried in the official  cemetery so Peters snuck in one night  and buried his wife in secret then in  1924 he married a Danish millionairess  who was an heiress to a margarine  fortune Magdalene van Lauridsen and that  marriage lasted for 20 years despite him  being constantly away on various  expeditions all the time this marriage  was annulled then he finally settled  down with his third wife marrying a war  Widow called Dagmar Cohen  she was a Danish Jewish fashion  illustrator whose work had appeared on  famous magazine covers such as Vogue and  Harper's Bazaar they married in 1945 in  the USA after marriage his wife was  known as Dagmar Freudian Gale Peter  Freudian seemed to find a spiritual  happiness in Greenland freaken learnt  the Eskimo dialect and soon he was  looked upon as an Anna gawk a medicine  man in touch with the divine spirits the  Explorer dressed in full Inuit attire  describe the Inuit people as the  happiest in the world in turn  Greenlanders called him Peter sock or  Peter the Great the Danish government  had appointed him resident governor of  fool colony in 1913 a post he held for  seven years he was a close friend of the  legendary polar explorer canoed  Rasmussen who came from Greenland and is  often referred to as the father of s  Kamala G for akan learnt many survival  skills from Rasmussen and the Inuits he  had learned how to hunt and eat seal  meat clothed himself in animal skins and  survive against predators who might try  to kill him they went on many  expeditions together until Rasmussen  died from eating contaminated arctic  duck that had been allowed to ferment  the traditional Inuit way inside the  skin of a dead seal for several months  Freud kin had many close brushes with  death in his long career as an explorer  he once survived an avalanche while on  another occasion he fell down a crevasse  and lived to tell the tale then there  was the time he fell through thin ice  into the freezing cold sea having to  drag himself out using a rope hitch to  his own dog sleigh and another time when  he was out hunting Freud can seriously  injured himself in the thigh with a  harpoon as he was descending down a  glacier by rope but even when he was at  his own Basecamp he was not safe one  particularly foggy day a colleague  nearly shot him by mistake thinking he  was a bear which was hardly surprising  as Freud was six feet seven inches tall  and had a wild scraggly beard and was  wearing a thick fur coat at the time but  his most famous story of survival was  said to be what he was buried alive in  the snow during a fierce blizzard  freudian was on an expedition in 1926 to  the frozen Greenland wastelands  unexpectedly he had been forced to take  shelter alone building a snow cave  between the rocks and his sled when a  snowstorm had suddenly appeared from  nowhere  after he had fallen asleep in the  sheltered spot he had later awoken to  find that he had become trapped by the  drifting snow but when one version he  said it was because of an avalanche  whichever it was the snow had become so  tightly packed above him he could barely  move in his sleeping bag and was in  serious danger of being stuck there  slowly freezing to death and to make  matters worse he realized he had left  his snow knife in his nearby sled which  he could now not get to in his first  attempt to escape he managed to tear a  piece of polar bear skin from the coat  he was wearing he then sharpened it by  chewing and spitting on it and waiting  patiently for the saliva to freeze rigid  he then used it to slowly chip away at  the snow and ice that was trapping him  deep below the surface so after many  hours of tunneling passing in and out of  consciousness as he did so he finally  came close to the surface only to find  himself stuck beneath his own sled  because of his breathing and drooling  saliva his beard had become moist now  his face was covered in blood as a part  of his beard and facial skin had been  ripped clean off when had become frozen  to the bottom of one of the sled runners  hours passed after repeated desperate  efforts to escape then a moment of  inspiration came to him he remembered  that dog feces often stuck to the tracks  of the sled freezing rock solid so Freud  decided to make a chisel from his own  feces to get out Freud did this by  waiting for his next bowel movement and  then fashioned his feces into a chisel  shape as it rapidly cooled in the snow  eventually it froze rock-hard if the  tool broke then he was dead so he waited  for some time then scraped and scraped  finally emerging free from his near icy  demise Freud come his legs frozen then  crawled for nearly three hours in  sub-zero temperatures to the expedition  camp once he was there it was discovered  his toes on his left foot were so badly  frostbitten by his ordeal  Green had started to set in he was taken  to the settlement at Danish Island where  the nurse there used the warm freshly  killed hides of lemmings to clean the  infected wound she would lay the tiny  lemming hides bloody side down on the  rotting toes and then a few hours later  she would gently peel them off as the  nurse did this the decaying flesh around  Freud khun's toes would come off to  having stuck to the undersides of the  hides this process was repeated until  the wound was completely free of  decaying flesh now sadly all that  remained was skeletal bone where once on  his left foot toes had been the nurse  then offered to bite off the disfigured  toes but he declined her kind offer in a  state of delirium he instead decided to  take the drastic step of amputating them  himself as the settlement had no doctor  so he removed them with a pair of  heavy-duty pincers a chisel and a hammer  he had to do this without any  anaesthetic as none was available in  such an isolated settlement nor could he  even use alcohol to numb the pain as he  was a teetotaler Freud condition and two  years later lost the leg completely to  gangrene while on yet another Arctic  expedition having to have it replaced  with a wooden peg leg in 1933 Peter  wrote the screenplay for a German movie  called Eskimo which was based on his own  experiences and even starred in the  movie as the captain filmed in Alaska  many of the scenes were actually real  including the hunting and wolf attacks  the movie would win the Academy Award  for best film editing and be the first  motion picture shot in a Native American  language Peter went on to establish the  famous adventurers Club in Denmark in  1938 and when world war ii brought about  the german occupation of his danish  homeland he did not hesitate to join the  resistance movement there despite it  being a great risk to himself as he was  Jewish Freud Caen was sentenced by the  Germans to death when he was captured  and arrested but he managed to escape  with his peg  by climbing a barbed-wire fence without  protection he escaped to Sweden and then  after the war moved to the USA after  Peter freaking moved to New York he  joined the New York explorers club over  the course of his life he won many  honors awards and literary prizes  including the prestigious Hannes Agra  medal from the Royal Danish geographical  society he also settled down and married  Dagmar Cohen they made many friends in  Hollywood where freudian was popular  because of his work and he could often  be seen lifting and twirling celebrities  above his head Freud would go on to win  the top prize on the American TV quiz  show the $64,000 question in 1956 the  prize would be worth over half a million  dollars today but sadly he had little  time to enjoy it  Freud condign at the age of 71  three days after finishing his last  written work book of the seven seas from  a heart attack while walking up the  steps to a plane in Anchorage Alaska his  ashes were scattered over through  Greenland  [Music]  hey guys check out this simple history  merch on teespring there's t-shirts mugs  stickers phone cases and much more link  in the description below  [Music]
