against Vietcong insurgents in the North  Vietnamese Army took place deep in the  jungles as part of the South Vietnam  pacifying program general william  Westmoreland commander of the US Army  during the Vietnam War applied the  Search and Destroy tactic the tactic  included reconnaissance patrols deep in  the insurgents territory with the aim to  find and eliminate their strong points  for the Americans and their allies these  missions were highly dangerous as well  as patrolling far away from their bases  soldiers were exposed to ambushes from  an enemy that was well hidden and much  better accustomed to fighting in the  harsh environment of the jungle however  the most terrifying threat to patrolling  soldiers were booby traps  booby traps were certainly one of the  most notorious weapons of the Vietnam  War  as they became an integral part of the  war strategy of the Viet Cong and the  NVA they were used so often that they  served as both defensive and offensive  weapons during the war Viet Cong and NVA  soldiers became highly experienced in  making deadly contraptions that were  responsible for the deaths of a great  number of American soldiers booby traps  were highly effective despite the fact  that they were primitive and made using  widely available materials such as  bamboo iron mud and coconuts these  devices were used to delay and disrupt  the American forces and their allies the  threat of booby traps was often enough  to slow any advance to a snail's pace  divert resources towards guard duty and  clearance operations inflict casualties  and damaged equipment when properly  camouflaged they were very difficult to  detect  especially for soldiers exhausted by  long and enduring patrols  additionally booby traps were often  covered by snipers to trigger an ambush  apart from being highly dangerous booby  traps were also used to psychologically  so fear among the enemy the fear of  booby traps was so great that field  units were under constant stress which  created severe mental fatigue on both  officers and soldiers punji stakes punji  traps were long nails or sharpened steel  rods hammered through bamboo and wood  these spiked blocks were hammered to the  bottom of a wooden box which was then  dug into a shallow hole or rice paddy at  the top of the wooden box was covered  with a thin frame with grass crops  leaves and mud camouflage once a soldier  on patrol stepped on it his leg would  fall through and fallen the spikes her  stakes inside it was impossible to  remove a trapped leg or legs without  severe damage spikes were often smeared  with excrement urine or poison to cause  an infection within the victims wound  small punji traps had sides around 16  inches wide and were around 23 inches  deep there was also a large version of  this punji stakes trap this huge hole  was filled with sharpened bamboo stakes  pointing in various directions  the top frame fitted with a cover was  also made of bamboo camouflaged with mud  and leaves and fastened around an axle  if a soldier stepped on it he would fall  into the pit and the top cover would  turn on the axle to its previous  position covering the trap and waiting  for a new victim to fall in during  periods of ceasefire insurgents would  lock the cover with a bamboo cross beam  this was the most basic design for a  punji stakes wrap punji traps were laid  wherever the enemy was likely to land  with some force such as stream banks  helicopter landing zones or where they  would take cover to escape gunfire such  as ditches behind logs or in long grass  spike board spike boards consisted of a  treadle board with one side covered in  spikes if a soldier stepped on a treadle  the opposite spike side will fly up  straight into his face or chest the  possibility of surviving a trap was very  low trap bridge the trap bridge was  usually set up over a ditch filled with  water or mud and lined with sharpened  bamboo sticks sticks were cut low so  they did not protrude over the waterline  or the ditch was blocked to keep the  water level high therefore keeping them  hidden  if this wasn't possible then the sticks  were covered in mud the middle of the  bridge was partially cut so that it  would break under the weight of the  soldiers crossing over it once the  bridge broke down all soldiers standing  on it would fall on sharp bamboo sticks  trap bridges were used to hinder the  progress of search and clearing  operations venus flytrap the venus  flytrap was another box trap in the case  of this trap spikes were not hammered to  the bottom of the box but to its sides  instead spikes were overlapped and  pointed downwards the injury would not  be inflicted when the soldiers foot fell  inside but once he tried to get it out  side closing trap  a side closing trap consisted of two  wooden slats with spikes attached both  slats were fastened to to guide rods  made of iron and were tightened with  heavy rubber bands when a soldier  dislodged the BOP holding the slats  apart the slats would spring together  impaling his body bear trap  another type of side closing trap if the  bear trap was a small trap that  consisted of two spiked wooden boards  joined at the end so they would pivot  upwards boards were placed in a shallow  camouflaged hole once stepped on the  boards would strike the victim above his  foot this trap was a traditional one  used by locals for hunting bears Tiger  trap another hunting trap was the Tiger  trap unlike the bear trap this one  struck from above the trap consisted of  a large spike studded board suspended in  a tree above the road or path and  weighted with bricks and stones the  board was connected to a tripwire when  the wire was triggered by a patrolling  soldier they would unlink the trap to  fall down and kill anyone standing below  mace trap somewhat similar was the mace  trap instead of falling down directly  from above the mace trap would swing  down taking out everyone in its way the  mace was made in various forms it could  be made as a concrete ball a spiked mud  ball a wooden box or as it was most  often a spiked log mace traps were  usually very heavy and a large number of  spikes were welded onto it it was  suspended in a tree on the end of a rope  or cable and attached to a tripwire on  the enemy pathway mace traps functioned  as a pendulum impaling the victims it  usually struck a large number of  soldiers at once it was one of the most  frequent and most fearsome of all booby  traps in the Vietnam War  door trap  this type of danger also existed in  buildings very often these kind of  swinging traps were scaled down to fit  inside of a house door traps were given  their name because they were suspended  over the entrance of a doorway by  opening the door the soldier would  release the tripwire which would release  the spiked bamboo stick or a smaller log  and impale him bamboo whip trap  another distinctive Vietnam War booby  trap was the whip trap the bamboo pole  was bent and held in an arch position by  a catch connected to a tripwire  stepping on the tripwire would simply  release the catch forcing the bamboo  pole into its original position  striking the victim in the chest or legs  there were versions with or without  spikes attached to the pole whip traps  could be positioned at different heights  depending on the surroundings with or  without spikes the whip trap was  powerful enough to inflict heavy  injuries snake pits snake pits were a  special kind of animal booby-trapped  American soldiers were most afraid of  the Vietcong often carried bamboo Green  pit vipers and backpacks so if the enemy  would search inside these backpacks they  would be bitten the same sort of Vipers  were used in sight rat tunnels tied to  bamboo sticks once the stick was moved  the Viper would fall on the passing  soldier and bite him those Vipers were  also tied up to tree branches at face  level after a couple of days due to  hanging without any food they would  strike anyone that came within their  vicinity these snakes were highly  venomous although in exaggeration  American soldiers nicknamed them  two-step snakes Hornet trap a similar  but less aggressive trap was the Hornet  trap hives of Hornets or bees were  placed along the patrol route and  covered with a piece of paper fashioned  to a trip wire once the trap was  triggered it would release the insects  to the misfortune of the enemy soldiers  very often this kind of trap was  accompanied by punji traps once attacked  by the hornets soldiers would panic and  run away from the paved path straight  into the hidden traps waiting for them  arrow trap this was probably the most  sophisticated non-explosive booby trap  it consisted of a long wooden board with  a three feet long bamboo tube attached  to it inside the tube was a narrow  powered by a strong rubber band which  was attached to the catch at the bottom  of the board the catch was connected to  a tripwire laid across the path arrow  traps were placed in an angle at certain  distances so when a victim triggered the  tripwire he would release the catch  holding the rubber band and send an  arrow straight into his own torso booby  trap markers the Vietcong designed booby  traps to hold back American soldiers on  their Search and Destroy missions  however these traps were equally  dangerous to all soldiers who bumped  into them so they created markers to  indicate where there was a booby trap in  the vicinity by knowing how to interpret  these markers they could determine the  distance and a direction of the booby  trap it was knowledge of vital  importance to American patrols the hard  part was that there were many different  markers sometimes these were sticks laid  in patterns forked sticks  folded palm leaves or broken branches  bamboo tripods and bamboo rectangles  laid on the ground were standard markers  but even though they were relatively  large they were still hard to notice  soldiers on patrol had to pay attention  to too many things around them to be  fully focused on noticing these markers  on long tiring marches their awareness  was especially low and in these  situations patrolling soldiers were easy  victims to these potentially deadly  booby traps
